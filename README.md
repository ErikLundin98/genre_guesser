# Genre Guessing in R

As a way to learn how to implement machine learning models in R, I created a custom ensemble classifier which predicts song genre based on audio features such as average beats per minute, frequency and other more complicated measurements. See the [R Markdown File](https://github.com/ErikLundin98/public/blob/main/genre_guesser/genreguesser.md) for a more detailed report of the classifier and procedure.
